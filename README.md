# KAS Technical Test

The idea is to build an API Rest which parses the JSON received 
from a resource. 

This API should be built using Spring Boot framework.

### Prerequisites

first you should have installed:
* **Java Development Kit** - *JDK >= 1.8.0_6X* - 
[Oracle Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* **Maven Build Tool** - *version >= 3.3.X* - 
[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

### Build Management

* Command to compile and run the application: **mvn spring-boot:run**
* Command to compile and generate binaries: **mvn clean install**
* Command to run tests: **mvn test**
